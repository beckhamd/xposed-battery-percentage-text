Battery Percentage Text
=======================

This is an Xposed module for Android Lollipop/Marshmallow (5.x.x/6.x.x) that adds the current battery percentage to the lock screen, notification shade header, and status bar. The app includes options for enabling or disabling the injected text, changing the position of the text relative to the battery icon, and changing the size of the text.
